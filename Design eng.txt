Part I

1. We need to provide exploratory data analysis. Check data for outliers and overall quality. 
	Answer the questions: 
	- Are there mistakes in data?
	- Are there gaps in data?
	- What to do if there is no data or it is incorrect?

2. Answer the question: 
	Who's the most success athlete in whole Olympics history?

3. Analyse the dynamics of medals distribution by country. Visualize it.

4. Answer the question: 
	Is there a relationship between host country of the games, athlethes country of origin and the number of medals earned? 

5. Answer the question:
	Is there a relationship between physical data (height/weight) of athletes and an the number of wins in particular discipline?

6. Answer the question:
	Who is the most motivated athlete? (Went to his gold medal for a long time)

7. Answer the question:
	How does average age of athletes change during the time?

8. Build a "Retention" chart of the games participation. 
	Answer the question: What percentage of athletes return to each next Olympiad?

9. Individual case. Try to find something interesting in the data, visualize and describe.


Part II

Imagine that this dataset locates on MySQL database and the table name is 'athlete_events'. 

1. Write SQL query which helps to see TOP-10 athletes with the most numbers of podiums (1-3 place). For each athlete print the number of medals (for 1st, 2nd and 3rd places in separate lines).

2. Also print with SQL:
	1. Country with the less number of medals.
	2. The number of participants by the year of the games.
	3. MAX and MIN age of the athletes for each Olympiad.
